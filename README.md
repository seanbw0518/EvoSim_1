# EvoSim_1

Just a fun personal project to teach myself Unity!

A bunch of "animals" roam around a terrain looking for food, water, and mates to reproduce. When they get thristy they look for water, when hungry they look for food, when tired they rest, and otherwise (if able) they breed.
If they get too thirsty, too hungry, or too tired they'll die.
When the animals reproduce, three "genes" are passed on to the offspring: idle speed, searching speed, and view distance along with a chance of mutation.

Press 'p' while playing to save statistics of the simulation up to that point. These are saved as csvs in the main directory.
